Keywords:

this -> Refrence Keyword
static-> fixed[If Will use static it's used previous memory allocation]
final -> it's fixed ,it can not be changed
super-> it's called parent class variable

Inheritance:
1)Single
2)Multilevel
3)Multiple-> is not supported in java
4)Hierarchical
5)Hybrid

what is the solution?
->Interface : Collection of abstract methods
abstract method : Which does not have a body part

Encapsulation:set - get[Model[getter-setter]]

Abstraction: Abstract Keyword

//Normal Class Only Support Non Abstract Method
//Abstract Class Supports Abstract as well as Non Abstract Methods
//Normal Class as well as Abstrcat class Both can be inherited
//Normal Class as well as Abstrcat class Both Supports Inheritance
//We can not create object of abstract class but we can instantiate them


Polymorphism:Many Ways to perform anything

1)Method Overloading: When two or more methods having a same name but number of parameters are diffrent

2)Method Overriding:When two or more methods having a same name and number of parameters are 
also same


//When Methods having a same name and same number of parameters at that time you can change data type
